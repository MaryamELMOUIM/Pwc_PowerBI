# PhoneNow Performance Dashboard - Final Report
The PhoneNow Performance Dashboard was created to provide a comprehensive and intuitive overview of key call center metrics. This dashboard enables PhoneNow to track performance, customer satisfaction, and agent efficiency in real-time. Here's an overview of the components and calculations used in the dashboard:

## Key Components and Metrics
### Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) Gauge:

* Metric: Customer satisfaction percentage (68.07%).
Calculation: The CSAT percentage was calculated by averaging customer satisfaction scores, typically on a scale from 1 to 5, and converting the results into a percentage.
Answered Calls Card:
* Metric: The total number of calls answered (4,054 calls).
Calls Resolved: 89.94% of the calls were resolved.
Calculation: The number of answered calls was calculated by counting the calls marked as answered, while the percentage of resolved calls was calculated by dividing resolved calls by the total answered calls.
  ### Abandoned Calls:

* Metric: 946 total abandoned calls and an 18.92% abandonment rate.
Calculation: Abandoned calls were counted, and the abandonment rate was calculated by dividing abandoned calls by the total calls and multiplying by 100.
Call Metrics:

* Average Talk Duration: 3 min 44 sec.
Average Wait Time: 68 seconds.
Calculation: Both average talk duration and wait times were calculated by averaging the respective time fields in the dataset.
Agent Performance:

Metric: Displayed the number of calls answered per agent. For instance, Jim answered 536 calls, Dan answered 523, and Becky answered 517.
Calculation: This table shows a simple count of answered calls per agent.
Calls by Day of the Week (Bar Chart):

Metric: Number of abandoned calls per day. Saturday had the highest number of abandoned calls (154), followed by Monday (141).
Calculation: This bar chart shows abandoned calls grouped by the day of the week, sorted in the correct order from Monday to Sunday.
